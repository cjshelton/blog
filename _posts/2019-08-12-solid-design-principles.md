## Introduction

<!-- excerpt-start -->
SOLID design principles are a fundamental set of guidelines for any software developer. Beyond the simplicity of a &#39;Hello World&#39; application, code bases naturally become very complex, involve lots of moving parts and are worked on by teams of developers. Because of this, it is important that the software we create is of good quality, is maintainable, readable, predictable and testable. The SOLID design principles help us achieve this.

These principles are covered in depth all over the internet, but aren't always explained in the clearest of ways, and in my opinion, miss out some key ways that these principles can be followed and implemented. I hope to add some clarity, and from experience, give my take on how they can be implemented.

I will focus mainly on examples in C&#35;, but these principles can always be applied in some way to almost any language.
